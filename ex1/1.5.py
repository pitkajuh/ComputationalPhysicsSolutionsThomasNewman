# A useful feature of user-defined functions is recursion, the ability of a function to call itself.
# For example, consider the following definition of the factorial n! of a positive integer n:

# This constitutes a complete definition of the factorial which allows us to calculate the value
# of n! for any positive integer. We can employ this definition directly to create a Python
# function for factorials, like this:

# Note how, if n is not equal to 1, the function calls itself to calculate the factorial of n âˆ’ 1.
# This is recursion. If we now say print(factorial(5)) the computer will correctly print
# the answer 120.
# (a) We encountered the Catalan numbers Cn previously in Exercise 1.3. With just a little
# rearrangement, the definition 

# Write a Python function, using recursion, that calculates Cn . Use your function to calculate
# and print C100 .
# (b) Euclid showed that the greatest common divisor g(m, n) of two nonnegative integers m
# and n satisfies

# Write a Python function g(m,n) that employs recursion to calculate the greatest common
# divisor of m and n using this formula. Use your function to calculate and print the greatest
# common divisor of 108 and 192.
# Comparing the calculation of the Catalan numbers in part (a) above with that of Exercise
# 1.3, we see that it's possible to do the calculation two ways, either directly or using
# recursion. In most cases, if a quantity can be calculated without recursion, then it will be


# faster to do so, and we normally recommend taking this route if possible. There are some
# calculations, however, that are essentially impossible (or at least much more difficult) without
# recursion. We will see some examples later in this book.
